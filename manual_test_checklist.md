ðŸŽ¯ Priority Testing Order

1. Start here: Test one protein detail page (/protein/egfp/)

3. Then: Complex forms (protein form, spectrum form)
4. Then: Interactive features (chart, lineage, FRET)
5. Finally: Less critical pages (organism list, activity)

---

- [ ] Elements not appearing (things that should load dynamically)
- [ ] Modals appearing behind backdrop (especially reference excerpts)
- [ ] Forms not submitting or validating incorrectly
- [ ] Buttons not responding to clicks
