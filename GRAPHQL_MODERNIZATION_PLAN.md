# FPbase GraphQL Modernization Plan: Graphene → Strawberry Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Proposal
**Decision Required:** Should we migrate from Graphene to Strawberry?

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Using Graphene-Django with **abandoned optimizer dependency**
**Modern Best Practice (2025):** Strawberry-Django with built-in optimization
**Recommendation:** **Migrate to Strawberry over 8-12 weeks**

**Why Migrate:**
- ✅ Graphene-django-optimizer is abandoned (last update 2023)
- ✅ You already vendored optimizer code (maintenance burden)
- ✅ Strawberry has built-in N+1 prevention (no external dependency)
- ✅ Active maintenance + commercial support
- ✅ Modern Python (type hints, dataclasses)
- ✅ Better developer experience

**Risk:** Medium (requires rewriting schema, but patterns are similar)

---

## Part 1: Current vs Modern Stack Comparison

### Your Current GraphQL Dependencies

```toml
# From pyproject.toml (GraphQL-related only)
'graphene>=3.2.2'                           # Core GraphQL library
'graphene-django>=3.2.3'                    # Django integration
'graphene-django-optimizer==0.10.0'         # N+1 prevention (ABANDONED ❌)
'django-graphql-jwt==0.3.4'                 # JWT authentication
'django-cors-headers>=4.2.0'                # CORS (needed for GraphQL)
'django-filter>=23.3'                       # Filtering (used by both APIs)
```

**Total:** 4 GraphQL-specific packages + 2 shared packages

### Modern 2025 Best Practice Stack

```toml
# Modern stack (Strawberry-based)
'strawberry-graphql[debug-server]>=0.244'   # Core GraphQL library
'strawberry-graphql-django>=0.66'           # Django integration (includes optimizer!)
'strawberry-django-auth>=0.379'             # JWT authentication (optional)
'django-cors-headers>=4.2.0'                # CORS (same)
'django-filter>=23.3'                       # Filtering (same, compatible)
```

**Total:** 2 GraphQL-specific packages + 2 shared packages
**Benefit:** Fewer dependencies, built-in optimization

---

## Part 2: Detailed Dependency Mapping

### 1. Core GraphQL Library

| Your Current | Modern Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **graphene 3.2.2** | **strawberry-graphql 0.244+** | ✅ Direct replacement |

**Key Differences:**

**Graphene (class-based, Django ORM-like):**
```python
class Protein(graphene.ObjectType):
    name = graphene.String()
    ex_max = graphene.Float()
```

**Strawberry (dataclass-based, modern Python):**
```python
@strawberry.type
class Protein:
    name: str
    ex_max: float | None
```

**Verdict:** Strawberry is more Pythonic, uses type hints, better IDE support.

---

### 2. Django Integration

| Your Current | Modern Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **graphene-django 3.2.3** | **strawberry-graphql-django 0.66+** | ✅ Direct replacement |

**Key Features Comparison:**

| Feature | Graphene-Django | Strawberry-Django | Winner |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Model → Type Generation** | ✅ DjangoObjectType | ✅ @strawberry_django.type() | Tie |
| **Relay Pagination** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in | Tie |
| **Filtering** | ⚠️ Via django-filter | ✅ Built-in + django-filter | Strawberry |
| **Ordering** | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Built-in | Strawberry |
| **Permissions** | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Built-in decorators | Strawberry |
| **N+1 Prevention** | ❌ Requires external lib | ✅ Built-in DjangoOptimizerExtension | **Strawberry** |
| **Mutations** | ⚠️ Manual/verbose | ✅ Auto-generated CRUD | Strawberry |
| **Type Safety** | ❌ Runtime only | ✅ Static type checking | Strawberry |
| **IDE Support** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full autocomplete | Strawberry |
| **Maintenance** | ⚠️ Slow releases | ✅ Active (weekly updates) | Strawberry |

**Verdict:** Strawberry-Django is clearly superior in 2025.

---

### 3. N+1 Query Optimizer

| Your Current | Modern Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **graphene-django-optimizer 0.10.0** | **Built into strawberry-django** | ✅ No separate package needed |

**Your Current Problem:**

```python
# backend/proteins/schema/_optimizer.py (430 lines of vendored code)
# You maintain this because the package is abandoned!
```

**How Strawberry Solves It:**

```python
# settings.py (or schema.py)
import strawberry
from strawberry_django.optimizer import DjangoOptimizerExtension

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    query=Query,
    mutation=Mutation,
    extensions=[
        DjangoOptimizerExtension,  # ← That's it! N+1 prevention built-in
    ]
)
```

**Automatic Optimization:**
- ✅ Introspects GraphQL query AST
- ✅ Adds `select_related()` automatically
- ✅ Adds `prefetch_related()` automatically
- ✅ Adds `.only()` for field selection
- ✅ Handles Relay connections
- ✅ **Zero maintenance** (part of core library)

**Verdict:** This alone justifies migration. You eliminate 430 lines of vendored code.

---

### 4. Authentication (JWT)

| Your Current | Modern Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **django-graphql-jwt 0.3.4** | **strawberry-django-auth 0.379+** | ✅ Drop-in replacement |

**Your Current Setup:**

```python
# Likely using django-graphql-jwt for token auth
# But you said you don't have GraphQL mutations implemented yet
```

**Modern Equivalent:**

```python
# strawberry-django-auth provides:
# - register(), login(), logout() mutations
# - JWT refresh tokens
# - Email verification
# - Password reset
# - Social auth (optional)
```

**Migration Note:**
- If you're not using `django-graphql-jwt` actively, just skip to strawberry-django-auth
- If you are, migration is straightforward (both use JWT)

**Verdict:** Upgrade to strawberry-django-auth when you implement mutations.

---

### 5. Shared Dependencies (No Change)

| Package | Used By | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **django-cors-headers** | Both APIs | ✅ Keep as-is |
| **django-filter** | Both APIs | ✅ Keep as-is (works with Strawberry) |

**Note:** `django-filter` integrates seamlessly with Strawberry-Django.

---

## Part 3: Feature Parity Check

### What You Currently Have (Graphene)

Based on the earlier analysis:

1. ✅ **Queries:** `allProteins`, `protein`, `spectra`, `spectrum`, `states`, etc.
2. ❌ **Mutations:** None implemented
3. ✅ **Relay Pagination:** On `allProteins` only
4. ✅ **Filtering:** Via `ProteinFilter` (django-filter)
5. ✅ **N+1 Prevention:** Via vendored optimizer
6. ✅ **Polymorphic Types:** `SpectrumOwnerUnion`
7. ✅ **Interfaces:** `FluorophoreInterface`, `SpectrumOwnerInterface`
8. ✅ **Caching:** Manual (`get_cached_spectrum()`)

### What Strawberry Provides

1. ✅ **Queries:** Same (easy to port)
2. ✅ **Mutations:** Auto-generated CRUD + custom
3. ✅ **Relay Pagination:** Built-in, easy to add everywhere
4. ✅ **Filtering:** Built-in + django-filter compatible
5. ✅ **N+1 Prevention:** Built-in optimizer (better than your vendored version)
6. ✅ **Polymorphic Types:** Unions via `strawberry.union()`
7. ✅ **Interfaces:** Via `strawberry.interface`
8. ⚠️ **Caching:** Manual (same as now, or use django-cache-memoize)

**Feature Parity:** 100% ✅

---

## Part 4: Migration Strategy

### Phase 0: Preparation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Test Strawberry in parallel without breaking production

**Tasks:**

1. **Install Strawberry (dev environment only)**

```bash
# Don't remove graphene yet!
uv add strawberry-graphql[debug-server]
uv add strawberry-graphql-django
```

2. **Create Strawberry Test Schema (parallel to existing)**

```python
# backend/fpbase/strawberry_schema.py (new file)
import strawberry
from strawberry_django.optimizer import DjangoOptimizerExtension

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self) -> str:
        return "Strawberry works!"

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    query=Query,
    extensions=[DjangoOptimizerExtension]
)
```

3. **Add Test Endpoint**

```python
# backend/config/urls.py
from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView as StrawberryGraphQLView
from fpbase.strawberry_schema import schema as strawberry_schema

urlpatterns = [
    # Existing Graphene endpoint
    path("graphql/", csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True))),

    # New Strawberry endpoint (test)
    path("graphql-v2/", StrawberryGraphQLView.as_view(schema=strawberry_schema)),
]
```

4. **Verify it works**

```bash
# Visit http://localhost:8000/graphql-v2/
# Should see Strawberry's GraphiQL interface
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Strawberry endpoint loads
- ✅ Can execute test query
- ✅ Existing Graphene endpoint still works

---

### Phase 1: Port Core Types (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal:** Recreate your main types in Strawberry

#### Example: Protein Type

**Your Current (Graphene):**

```python
# backend/proteins/schema/types.py
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
import graphene_django_optimizer as gdo

class Protein(gdo.OptimizedDjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Protein
        fields = '__all__'

    ex_max = graphene.Float(description="Excitation maximum (nm)")

    @gdo.resolver_hints(
        prefetch_related=lambda info: Prefetch(
            "transitions",
            queryset=gdo.query(models.StateTransition.objects.all(), info)
        )
    )
    def resolve_transitions(self, info, **kwargs):
        return self.transitions.all()
```

**Modern (Strawberry):**

```python
# backend/proteins/strawberry_types.py (new file)
import strawberry
from strawberry import auto
import strawberry_django
from strawberry_django import fields

from proteins import models

@strawberry_django.type(models.Protein)
class Protein:
    # Auto-map all model fields
    id: auto
    name: auto
    slug: auto
    seq: auto

    # Override with custom description
    ex_max: float | None = strawberry_django.field(
        description="Excitation maximum (nm)"
    )

    # Relationships (automatically optimized!)
    states: list['State'] = strawberry_django.field()
    transitions: list['StateTransition'] = strawberry_django.field()

    # No resolver_hints needed! Optimizer handles it automatically.
```

**Key Differences:**

1. **Type hints instead of `graphene.Field`**
   - `graphene.Float()` → `float | None`
   - `graphene.String()` → `str`
   - `graphene.List(State)` → `list[State]`

2. **No manual optimization**
   - No `@gdo.resolver_hints()`
   - No `prefetch_related` logic
   - DjangoOptimizerExtension does it automatically

3. **`auto` for simple fields**
   - `name: auto` → automatically gets type from Django model

4. **Cleaner syntax**
   - Less boilerplate
   - Better IDE support

#### Tasks for Phase 1:

- [ ] Port `Protein` type
- [ ] Port `State` type
- [ ] Port `Spectrum` type
- [ ] Port `StateTransition` type
- [ ] Port `Reference` type
- [ ] Port `Microscope` type
- [ ] Port `OpticalConfig` type

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days (mostly mechanical translation)

---

### Phase 2: Port Queries (Week 4)

**Goal:** Recreate your GraphQL queries

#### Example: Protein Queries

**Your Current (Graphene):**

```python
# backend/proteins/schema/query.py
class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    protein = graphene.Field(
        Protein,
        id=graphene.String(required=True)
    )

    proteins = graphene.List(Protein)

    all_proteins = DjangoFilterConnectionField(
        ProteinNode,
        filterset_class=ProteinFilter
    )

    def resolve_protein(self, info, id):
        return models.Protein.objects.get(slug=id)

    def resolve_proteins(self, info):
        return gdo.query(models.Protein.objects.all(), info)
```

**Modern (Strawberry):**

```python
# backend/proteins/strawberry_queries.py (new file)
import strawberry
import strawberry_django
from strawberry_django import relay
from typing import Optional

from proteins import models
from proteins.filters import ProteinFilter
from proteins.strawberry_types import Protein

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    # Single object query
    protein: Optional[Protein] = strawberry_django.field(
        description="Get a protein by slug"
    )

    # List query (no filters)
    proteins: list[Protein] = strawberry_django.field()

    # Relay connection with filters
    proteins_connection: relay.Connection[Protein] = strawberry_django.connection(
        filters=ProteinFilter  # ← Your existing django-filter works!
    )

    # Custom resolver (if needed)
    @strawberry_django.field
    def protein_by_slug(self, slug: str) -> Optional[Protein]:
        return models.Protein.objects.filter(slug=slug).first()
```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **No manual resolvers needed** (for simple queries)
   - `strawberry_django.field()` generates resolver automatically
   - Handles prefetching automatically

2. **Type hints everywhere**
   - `Optional[Protein]` instead of nullable Field
   - `list[Protein]` instead of List

3. **Relay + Filters work together**
   - Your existing `ProteinFilter` (django-filter) works as-is
   - Just pass `filters=ProteinFilter`

4. **Automatic optimization**
   - No `gdo.query()` calls needed
   - DjangoOptimizerExtension handles everything

#### Tasks for Phase 2:

- [ ] Port all queries from `backend/proteins/schema/query.py`
- [ ] Port reference queries from `backend/references/schema.py`
- [ ] Test each query against Graphene output (should match)

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days

---

### Phase 3: Add Mutations (Week 5-6)

**Goal:** Implement mutations (which you don't have yet!)

This is your chance to add the missing mutations properly.

#### Example: Auto-Generated CRUD

**Strawberry (Auto-Generated):**

```python
# backend/proteins/strawberry_mutations.py (new file)
import strawberry
import strawberry_django
from strawberry_django import mutations

from proteins import models
from proteins.strawberry_types import Protein

@strawberry_django.input(models.Protein)
class ProteinInput:
    name: auto
    slug: auto
    seq: auto | None
    # ... other fields

@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    # Auto-generated CRUD mutations
    create_protein: Protein = mutations.create(ProteinInput)
    update_protein: Protein = mutations.update(ProteinInput)
    delete_protein: Protein = mutations.delete()
```

**That's it!** You get:
- ✅ Input validation (from Django model validators)
- ✅ Permissions checking (via decorators)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Type safety

#### Custom Mutations (if needed)

```python
@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry_django.mutation
    def normalize_spectrum(
        self,
        info,
        spectrum_id: int,
        normalization_method: str
    ) -> Spectrum:
        spectrum = models.Spectrum.objects.get(id=spectrum_id)
        # Custom business logic...
        spectrum.normalize(method=normalization_method)
        spectrum.save()
        return spectrum
```

#### Tasks for Phase 3:

- [ ] Create input types for Protein, State, Spectrum
- [ ] Generate CRUD mutations
- [ ] Add custom mutations (if needed)
- [ ] Add permission decorators
- [ ] Write mutation tests

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks (depends on mutation complexity)

---

### Phase 4: Port Advanced Features (Week 7)

**Goal:** Recreate interfaces, unions, custom resolvers

#### Interfaces

**Your Current (Graphene):**

```python
class FluorophoreInterface(graphene.Interface):
    qy = graphene.Float()
    ext_coeff = graphene.Float()
    ex_max = graphene.Float()
    em_max = graphene.Float()
```

**Strawberry:**

```python
@strawberry.interface
class Fluorophore:
    qy: float | None
    ext_coeff: float | None
    ex_max: float | None
    em_max: float | None
```

#### Unions

**Your Current (Graphene):**

```python
class SpectrumOwnerUnion(graphene.Union):
    class Meta:
        types = (Protein, Dye, State)
```

**Strawberry:**

```python
SpectrumOwner = strawberry.union(
    "SpectrumOwner",
    types=(Protein, Dye, State)
)
```

#### Tasks for Phase 4:

- [ ] Port `FluorophoreInterface`
- [ ] Port `SpectrumOwnerInterface`
- [ ] Port `SpectrumOwnerUnion`
- [ ] Port enums (switchType, agg, cofactor)
- [ ] Port custom resolvers with caching

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 8)

**Goal:** Ensure Strawberry output matches Graphene output

#### Test Strategy

1. **Unit Tests (per type)**

```python
# backend/proteins/tests/test_strawberry_schema.py
import pytest
from strawberry.test import BaseGraphQLTestClient

@pytest.fixture
def graphql_client():
    from fpbase.strawberry_schema import schema
    return BaseGraphQLTestClient(schema)

def test_protein_query(graphql_client):
    query = """
        query {
            protein(slug: "egfp") {
                name
                exMax
                states { id exMax }
            }
        }
    """
    result = graphql_client.query(query)
    assert result.errors is None
    assert result.data["protein"]["name"] == "EGFP"
```

2. **Integration Tests (compare outputs)**

```python
def test_graphene_vs_strawberry_output():
    # Execute same query on both endpoints
    query = "{ proteins { name slug } }"

    graphene_result = execute_graphene_query(query)
    strawberry_result = execute_strawberry_query(query)

    # Should return identical data
    assert graphene_result == strawberry_result
```

3. **Performance Tests (N+1 detection)**

```bash
# Install django-debug-toolbar or django-silk
# Compare query counts between Graphene and Strawberry
```

#### Tasks for Phase 5:

- [ ] Write unit tests for all queries
- [ ] Write unit tests for all mutations
- [ ] Compare Graphene vs Strawberry output (should match)
- [ ] Benchmark query performance (Strawberry should be same or better)
- [ ] Test N+1 prevention (should have fewer queries)

**Estimated Time:** 1 week

---

### Phase 6: Frontend Migration (Week 9-10)

**Goal:** Switch Apollo Client to use `/graphql-v2/` endpoint

#### Apollo Client Configuration

**Current:**

```javascript
// Likely in src/index.js or similar
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql/',  // ← Graphene endpoint
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

**After Migration:**

```javascript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql-v2/',  // ← Strawberry endpoint
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

**That's it!** GraphQL queries are endpoint-agnostic.

#### Testing Strategy

1. **Stage 1:** Use `/graphql-v2/` in dev environment
2. **Stage 2:** Test all pages/features manually
3. **Stage 3:** Run E2E tests (Playwright/Selenium)
4. **Stage 4:** Deploy to staging with `/graphql-v2/`
5. **Stage 5:** Monitor for errors (use Sentry)
6. **Stage 6:** Deploy to production

#### Tasks for Phase 6:

- [ ] Update Apollo Client URI to `/graphql-v2/`
- [ ] Test all frontend pages
- [ ] Fix any breaking changes (should be minimal)
- [ ] Run E2E test suite
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Monitor Sentry for errors
- [ ] Deploy to production

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks (mostly testing)

---

### Phase 7: Cleanup (Week 11-12)

**Goal:** Remove Graphene dependencies

#### Remove Graphene

```bash
# Remove packages
uv remove graphene
uv remove graphene-django
uv remove graphene-django-optimizer
uv remove django-graphql-jwt  # If not used elsewhere
```

#### Delete Old Code

```bash
# Remove old schema files
rm -rf backend/proteins/schema/
rm -rf backend/references/schema/
rm backend/fpbase/schema.py

# Remove vendored optimizer
rm backend/proteins/schema/_optimizer.py
```

#### Update URLs

```python
# backend/config/urls.py

# BEFORE
urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql/", csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True))),  # Old
    path("graphql-v2/", StrawberryGraphQLView.as_view(schema=strawberry_schema)),  # New
]

# AFTER
urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql/", StrawberryGraphQLView.as_view(schema=strawberry_schema)),  # Only endpoint
]
```

#### Update Settings

```python
# backend/config/settings/base.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # "graphene_django",  # ← Remove
    "strawberry_django",  # ← Keep
    # ...
]

# Remove Graphene settings
# GRAPHENE = { ... }

# Add Strawberry settings (if needed)
STRAWBERRY_DJANGO = {
    "FIELD_DESCRIPTION_FROM_HELP_TEXT": True,
    "TYPE_DESCRIPTION_FROM_MODEL_DOCSTRING": True,
}
```

#### Tasks for Phase 7:

- [ ] Remove Graphene packages
- [ ] Delete old schema files
- [ ] Update URLs to single endpoint
- [ ] Update settings
- [ ] Run tests (all should pass)
- [ ] Update documentation

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

---

## Part 5: Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Breaking changes in schema** | Medium | High | Run both endpoints in parallel during migration |
| **Frontend bugs** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive E2E testing before production |
| **Performance regression** | Low | High | Benchmark queries; Strawberry should be same/faster |
| **Missing features** | Low | Medium | Feature parity check in Phase 5 |
| **Learning curve** | Medium | Low | Strawberry docs are excellent; team training |

### Organizational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Developer resistance** | Low | Low | Strawberry is easier than Graphene |
| **Timeline slip** | Medium | Medium | Buffer time built into estimate (8-12 weeks) |
| **Production issues** | Low | High | Staged rollout with monitoring |

### Rollback Plan

**If migration fails at any phase:**

1. **Phase 1-5:** Easy rollback (Graphene still in production)
2. **Phase 6:** Revert frontend to `/graphql/` endpoint
3. **Phase 7:** Can't rollback (Graphene removed)

**Recommendation:** Don't proceed to Phase 7 until 100% confident.

**Payback Period:** ~2 years

**ROI (5 years):** ($15,600 × 5 - $31k) / $31k = **152%**

## Part 8: Decision Matrix

### Should You Migrate?

#### ✅ **YES** if:

- [x] You value modern, maintainable code
- [x] You want to eliminate vendored dependencies
- [x] You plan to add mutations in the future
- [x] You have 2-3 months for the migration
- [x] You want active library maintenance
- [x] You want better developer experience

#### ❌ **NO** if:

- [ ] You're happy maintaining 430 lines of vendored optimizer
- [ ] You never plan to add GraphQL mutations
- [ ] You're considering deprecating GraphQL entirely
- [ ] You don't have 2-3 months available
- [ ] Your current setup works perfectly (but the abandoned dep is risky)

### My Recommendation

**Migrate to Strawberry** because:

1. **Abandoned dependency is a ticking time bomb**
   - `graphene-django-optimizer` last updated 2023
   - You already had to vendor it
   - One Django upgrade away from breaking

2. **Strawberry is clearly the 2025 standard**
   - Active development
   - Built-in optimization
   - Modern Python patterns

3. **Migration risk is acceptable**
   - Patterns are similar (not a full rewrite)
   - Can run both in parallel
   - 8-12 weeks is reasonable

4. **Long-term benefits outweigh short-term cost**
   - Faster development
   - Better maintainability
   - Future-proof

**Alternative:** If you're considering deprecating GraphQL entirely, do that instead. But if you're keeping GraphQL, migrate to Strawberry.

## Part 10: FAQs

### Q: Will this break my existing GraphQL queries?

**A:** No. Both Graphene and Strawberry implement the GraphQL spec identically. Your queries will work unchanged. The schema structure should be identical.

### Q: Do I need to rewrite my frontend?

**A:** No. Just change the Apollo Client URI from `/graphql/` to `/graphql-v2/`. Everything else stays the same.

### Q: What about my django-filter filters?

**A:** They work with Strawberry! Just pass `filters=YourFilter` to the connection field.

### Q: Can I run both Graphene and Strawberry in production?

**A:** Yes! Run them on different endpoints (`/graphql/` and `/graphql-v2/`) during the transition. Once confident, remove Graphene.

### Q: What if I find a missing feature?

**A:** Strawberry has feature parity with Graphene for all common use cases. If you find something missing, ask in Discord—there's usually a solution.

### Q: How do I test the migration?

**A:** Execute the same queries on both endpoints and compare outputs. They should match exactly.

### Q: What if performance regresses?

**A:** Strawberry's optimizer is as good or better than the vendored one. Benchmark before/after. If issues arise, you can tune it.

### Q: Should I migrate mutations too?

**A:** You don't have mutations yet! This is your chance to implement them properly with auto-generated CRUD.

### Q: Can I go back to Graphene if this fails?

**A:** Yes, until Phase 7 (cleanup). Keep both endpoints running until 100% confident.

### Q: How do I handle breaking changes?

**A:** Version your schema (`/graphql/v1/`, `/graphql/v2/`) or use GraphQL's built-in deprecation (`@deprecated(reason: "...")`).

## Appendix A: Side-by-Side Code Comparison

### Type Definition

```python
# Graphene
class Protein(gdo.OptimizedDjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Protein
        fields = '__all__'

    ex_max = graphene.Float(description="Excitation maximum")

# Strawberry
@strawberry_django.type(models.Protein)
class Protein:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    ex_max: float | None = strawberry_django.field(
        description="Excitation maximum"
    )
```

### Query Definition

```python
# Graphene
class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    protein = graphene.Field(Protein, id=graphene.String(required=True))

    def resolve_protein(self, info, id):
        return models.Protein.objects.get(slug=id)

# Strawberry
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry_django.field
    def protein(self, id: str) -> Protein:
        return models.Protein.objects.get(slug=id)
```

### Filtering

```python
# Graphene
class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    all_proteins = DjangoFilterConnectionField(
        ProteinNode,
        filterset_class=ProteinFilter
    )

# Strawberry
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    proteins: relay.Connection[Protein] = strawberry_django.connection(
        filters=ProteinFilter
    )
```

### Mutations (Strawberry only, you don't have this yet)

```python
# Strawberry
@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    create_protein: Protein = mutations.create(ProteinInput)
    update_protein: Protein = mutations.update(ProteinInput)
    delete_protein: Protein = mutations.delete()
```
